# Use OpenId for authentication and authorization with Apache-Kafka

OpenId is a defacto standard for authentification and authorization. You can expect that a modern legacy environment does
use any kind of service providing OpenId within their application landscape with some OpenId-Service-Provider.

Using Kafka as a streaming backbone it would be nice to have Kafka using a already existing authentication and
authorization service provider.

The goal of this invastigation is to find out if you could martirialize Kafka in a way that you don't have to configure
any authorization within Kafka but let it use a OpenId Token for authorization.
