It contains two callback handler classes which implements the AuthenticateCallbackHandler interface from Kafka:

* Login callback handler: used by Kafka brokers (for inter-broker communication) and Kafka clients to authenticate themselves with OpenIDConnect server to obtain ID token.
* Validator callback handler: used by Kafka brokers to validate ID token of incoming requests.

The OpenIDConnect server is configured via environment variables.
